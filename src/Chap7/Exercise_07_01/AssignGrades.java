/**
 (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score,
 and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:

 Grade is A if score is >= best - 5;
 Grade is B if score is >= best - 10;
 Grade is C if score is >= best - 15;
 Grade is D if score is >= best - 20;
 Grade is F otherwise.

 The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
 the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here
 is a sample run:
