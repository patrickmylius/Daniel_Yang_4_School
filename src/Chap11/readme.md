#CHAPTER SUMMARY
###Chapter 11 - Inheritance and Polymorphism
1. You can define a new class from a existing class. This is known as class inheritance.
The new class is called a subclass, childclass orextended class. The exisiting class is called a superclass, parent class, or base class.

2. A constructor is used to to construct an instance of a scalss. Unlike properties and methods,
the constructors of a superclass are not inherited in the subclass. They can be invoked only from the constructors of the subclasses, using the keyword super.

3. A constructor may invoke an overloaded construyctor or its superclass's contructor.
The call must be the first statement in the constructor. If none of them is invoked explicitly, the compiler puts super()
as the first statement in the constructor, which invokes the superc√¶ass's no-arg constructor.

4. To override a method, the method must be defined in the subclass using the same signature and the same
or compatible return type as in its superclass.

5. An instance method can be overridden only if it is accessible. Thus, a private method cannot be overridden because it is not accessible outside its own
class. If a method defined in a subclass is private in its superclass, the two methods are completely unrelated.

6. Like an instance method, a static method can be inherited. However, a static method can not be overriden. If a static method defined in the superclass is redefined in a subclass,
the method defined in the superclass is hidden.

7. Every class in java is descended from the java.lang.Object class. If no superclass is specified when a class is defined, its superclass is Object.

8. If a method's parameter type is a superclass (e.g., Object), you may pass an object to this method of any of the parameter's subclasses
(e.g., Circle or String). This is known as polymorphism.

9. It is always possible to cast an instance of a subclass to a variable of a superclass because an instance of a subclass is always an instance
of its superclass. When casting an instance of a superclass to a variable of its sublcass, explicit casting must be used to confirm your intention
to the compiler with the (SubclassName) cast notation.

10. A class defines a type. A type defined by a subclass is called a subtype, and a type defined
by its superclass is called a supertype.

11. When invoking an instance method from a reference variable, the actual type of the variable decides which implementation
of the method is used at runtime. This is known as dynamic binding.

12. You can use obj instanceof AClass to tyest whether an object is an instance of a class.

13. You can use the ArrayList class to create an object to store a list of objects.

14. You can use the protected modifier to prevent the data and methods from being accessed by nonsubclasses from a different package.

15. You can use the final modifer to indicate a class is final and cannot be extended and to indicate a method is final and cannot be overriden.
