# CHAPTER SUMMARY
### Chapter 4 - Mathematical functions, characters and strings.
1. Java provides the mathematical methods sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, toRadians
, toDegrees, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, ceil, floor, rint, round, min, max, abs
and random in the Math class for performing mathematical function.

2. The character type char represents a single character.

3. An escape sequence consists of a backslash (\) followed by a character
or a combination of digits.

4. The character \ is called the escape character.

5. The characters ' ', \t, \f, \r and \n and known as the whitespace chars.

6. Characters can be compared based on their Unicode using the relational operators.

7. The Character Class contains the methods isDigit, isLetter, isLetterOrDigit,
isLowerCase, and isUpperCase for testing whether a char is a digit, letter,
lowercase, or uppercase. It also contains the toLowerCase and toUpperCase methods
for returning a lowercase or uppercase letter.

8. A string is a sequence of characters. A string value is enclosed in matching double
quotes ("). A character value is enclosed in matching single quotes (').

9. Strings are objects in Java. A method that can only be invoked from a specific
object is called an instance method. A noninstance method is called a static method,
which can be invoked without using an object.

10. You can get the length of a string by invoking its length() method, retrieve
a character at ther specified index in the string using the charAt(index) method,
and use the indexOf and lastIndexOf methods to find a character or a substring in
a string.

11. You can use the concat method concatenate two strings or the (+) operators
to concatenate two or more strings.

12. You can use the substring method to obtain a substring from the string.

13. You can use the equals and compareTo methods to compare strings.
The equals method returns true of two strings are equal, and false if they are not equal.
The compareTo methods returns 0, a positive integer, or a negative integer,
depending on whether on string is equal to, greater than, or less than the other string.

14. The prinf method can be used to display a formatted output using format specifiers.
