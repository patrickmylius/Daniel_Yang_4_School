# CHAPTER SUMMARY - Chapter 4 - Mathematical functions, characters and strings.
1. Java provides the mathematical methods sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, toRadians, toDegrees, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, ceil, floor, rint, round, min, max, abs, and random in the Math class for performing mathematical functions.
2. The character type char represents a single character.
3. An escape sequence consists of a backslash (\) fikkiwed by a character or a combination of digits.
4. The character \ is called the escape character.
5. The characters ' ', \t, \f, \r, and \n are known as the whitespace characters.
6. Characters can be compared based on their Unicode using the relational operators.
7. The character class contains the methods isDigit, isLetter, IsletterOrDigit, isLowerCase, and isUpperCase for testing whether a character is a digit, letter, lowercase, or uppercase. It also contains the toLowerCase and toUpperCase methods for returning a lowercase or uppercase letter.
8. A string is a sequence of characters. A string value is enclosed in matching double quotes ("). A character value is enclosed in matching single quotes (').
9. Strings are objects in Java. A method that can only be invoked from a specific object is called an instance method. A noninstance method is acalled a static method, which can be invoked without using an object.
10. You can get the length of a string by invoking its length() method, retrieve a character at the specified index in the string using charAt(index) method, and use the indexOf and astIndexOf methods to find a character or a substring in a string.
11. You can use the concat method to concatenate two string or the plus (+) operator to concatenate two or more strings.
12. You can use substring method to obtain a substring from the string.
13. You can use the equals and compareTo methods to compare strings. The equals method returns true if two string are equal, and false if they are not equal. The compareTo method returns 0, a positive integer, or a negative integer, depending on whether one string is equal to, greater than, or less than the other string.
14. The printf method can be used to display a formatted output using format specifiers.
