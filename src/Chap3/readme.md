# CHAPTER SUMMARY - Chapter 3 - Selektions
1. A boolean-type variable can store a true or false value.
2. The relational operators (<, <=, ==, !=, >, and >=) yield a Boolean value.
3. Selection statements are used for programming with alternative courses of actions. There are several types of selection statements: one-way if-else statements, switch statements, and conditional operators.
4. The various if statements all make control decisions based on a Boolean expression. based on the true of false evaluation of the expression, these statements take one of the two possible courses.
5. The boolean operators &&, ||, ! and ^ operate with Boolean values and variables.
6. When evaluating p1 && p2, Java first evaluates p1 and then evaluates p2 if p1 is true; if p1 is false, it does not evaluate p2, When evaluating p1 || p2, Java first evaluates p1 then evaluates p2 if p1 is false; if p1 is true, it does not evaluate p2. Therefore, && is referred to as the short-circuit or lazy AND operator, and || is referred to as the short-curcuit or lazy OR operator.
7. The switch statement makes control decisions based on a switch expression of type char, byte, short, int or String.
8. The keyword break is optional in a switch statement, but it is normally used at end of each case in order to skip the remainder of the switch statement. If the break statement is not present, the next case statement will be executed.
9. The operators in expressions are evaluated in the order determined by the rules of parentheses, operator precedence, and operator associativity.
10. Paretheses can be used to force the order of evaluation to occur in any sequence.
11. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated earlier. For operators of the same precedence, their associativity determines the order of evaluation.
12. All binary operators except assignment operators are left associative; assignment operators are right associative.
